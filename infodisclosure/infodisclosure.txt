Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability is that the query isn't sanitized so an attacker could insert a custom query to retrieve undisclossed information, the secure
version prevents this vulnerability by sanitizing the username that way if an attacker attemps to do a sql injection then it will return a 
invalid username error because the query won't meet the username requirements. 

This violates confidentiallity because the sql injection could disclose private information and also integrity because we are allowing an attacker
to change the code of our application. 

We could hash the passwords with SHA256 so the data isnt available to an attacker.
