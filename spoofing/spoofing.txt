Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that the session cookies are not set to be HTTP-only, 
which means they can be accessed by the client side scripts through JavaScript.
This makes the session vulnerable to session hijacking attacks where a hackercould 
steal the session cookies. 

The secure version prevents this vulnerability by setting cookies to be http-only so 
they cant be accessed by the client side making it harder for attackers to steal the session.
