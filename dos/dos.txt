- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability lies in the lack of a try and catch statement that can handle bad input that could cause a denial of service by sending
multiple requests that could crash the server. The secure handles this by sanitizing the input and adding a try and catch so if the input is 
wrong then that is caught and the DOS does not happen. 

We can add security measures such as limiting the amount of requests per seconds.
