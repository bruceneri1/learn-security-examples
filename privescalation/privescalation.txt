The user escalation problem here is that any user can downgrade the role of an admin. There is no password being asked so there is no authentication
, this can be solved by having a login page and having a session ID.
The secure version is signed by a secret key, so if anyone changes the session the key wont match and the secure property will be false. 
the session will be authenticated and this way no one can modify the priviliges of the admin.

Additional security measures could include two factor authentication.
